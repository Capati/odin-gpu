This example demonstrates how to render a colored triangle with smooth color interpolation between
vertices.

## Features

- Renders a colorful triangle on screen using vertex and fragment shaders
- Uses a vertex buffer to store triangle vertices (position and color data)
- Implements a complete render pipeline with vertex and fragment shaders

## Running

To build and run this example:

```shell
build.bat|sh 02_triangle run
```
